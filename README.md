This is Guy's sudoku assistant.
It doesn't tell you teh solution or give you hints
but it keeps track of the numbers that you've already
used so you can figure what's left to do.

Boxes refers to the 9 3x3 boxes that make up the Sudoku board.
VLines are the nine vertical lines that make up the Sudoku board.
HLines are the nine horizontal lines that make up the Sudoku board.
If you put two of the same number in one of the lines, you get an alert.
There's an undo button so you can revert the board to an earlier state.
There's also a file uploader so you can load puzzles from elsewhere.
It expects the file to consist of nine lines, each line contains
nine numbers (sepearating by any non-digit characters)
with 0 being used to denote empty squares.
